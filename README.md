Piccadilly wants its system to:
- [ ] Track all of its **customers** and any relevant customer information, such as customer ID, name, username/login details, delivery address(es), phone number(s), payment methods on file (e.g., cash, credit, check - if credit, then the card number should also be stored), etc.
- [ ] Track each customer's pizza **preferences**
- [ ] Track the **ingredients** that comprise each of these preferences (e.g., onions, ham, pineapple, anchovies, bacon, etc.)
- [ ] Track standard **drinks**, including a product ID, drink description, manufacturer, supplier, price
- [ ] Support calculating the proper sales tax (the pizza joint located at the intersection of the four corners of the US, so you might have to support sales taxes for Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah)
- [ ] Track its **pizza** sizes (small, medium, large, extra large), types (thick or thin crust), **ingredients** (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, cheese, etc.), price data for these pizza sizes and ingredients, and happy hour price discounts.

### Required
- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
## Quality Rubric
- The E-R diagram is fully fleshed out according to spec. 
- The E-R diagram includes whether or not each relationship in the schema is is one to one, one to many, or many to many. 
- The E-R diagram contains a list of attributes for each entity and relationship 
- The E-R diagram contains the SQL data types of each attribute in the schema
- The E-R diagram  notes any foreign or primary keys in each table in the schema
- The E-R diagram minimizes data redundancy
- There is a simple interface that allows one to CRUD the data in the specification (this interface can be as simple as a checkbox that "orders" a pizza by creating a DB record in one of your tables)
- Table names are singular, not plural
